Com o simulador, ́e poss ́ıvel realizar um planejamento de missa ̃o e avaliar os paraˆmetros do campo potencial, atrav ́es da visualiza ̧ca ̃o das trajeto ́rias simuladas. Outra funcionalidade deste ambiente ́e a integra ̧ca ̃o da ECS, com o simulador de voo XPlane⃝R , implantando o voo mu ́ltiplo em um ambiente muito pro ́ximo ao de uma situa ̧ca ̃o real.

It is necessary to find a balance between onboard electronics and robot operating time. This paper focuses not only on the development and implementation of a collision avoidance controller for a mini-VTOL robot using onboard ultrasound (US) sensors for detecting obstacles and for controlling its altitude, but also on the mathematical model that was essential for the controller developing phases as well. In order to facilitate the controller implementation, we developed a simulation tool in MatLab/Simulink using an accurate dynamic model of OS4 (our mini-VTOL robot). This tool allowed us to simulate and improve the OS4 controllers in different modeled environments and test different approaches. After that, the controllers were embedded in the real robot and the results were encouraging.

Our approach generalizes the concept of Velocity Obstacles to any robotic system with a linear Gaussian dynamics model. We integrate a Kalman filter for state estimation and an LQR feedback controller into a closed-loop dynamics model of which a higher-level control objective is the “control input”. We then define the LQG-Obstacle as the set of control objectives that result in a collision with high probability. Selecting a control objective outside the LQG-Obstacle then produces collision free motion. We demonstrate the potential of LQG-Obstacles by safely and smoothly navigating a simulated quadrotor helicopter with complex non-linear dynamics and motion and sensing uncertainty through three-dimensional environments with obstacles and narrow passages},

  Abstract                 = {Within the research on Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), the field on flight control and autonomous mission execution is one of the most active. A crucial point is the localization of the vehicle, which is especially difficult in unknown, GPS-denied environments. This paper presents a novel vision based approach, where the vehicle is localized using a downward looking monocular camera. A state-of-the-art visual SLAM algorithm tracks the pose of the camera, while, simultaneously, building an incremental map of the surrounding region. Based on this pose estimation a LQG/LTR based controller stabilizes the vehicle at a desired setpoint, making simple maneuvers possible like take-off, hovering, setpoint following or landing. Experimental data show that this approach efficiently controls a helicopter while navigating through an unknown and unstructured environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work describing a micro aerial vehicle able to navigate through an unexplored environment (independently of any external aid like GPS or artificial beacons), which uses a single camera as only exteroceptive sensor.},

This approach permits the detection of unknown obstacles simultaneously with the steering of the mobile robot to avoid collisions and advancing toward the target. The novelty of this approach, entitled the virtual force field, lies in the integration of two known concepts: Certainty grids for obstacle representa- tion, and potential fields for navigation. This combination is especially suitable for the accommodation of inaccurate sensor data (such as pro- duced by ultrasonic sensors) as well as for sensor fusion, and enables continuous motion of the robot without stopping in front of obstacles. This navigation algorithm also takes into account the dynamic behavior of a fast mobile robot and solves the local minimum trap problem. Experimental results from a mobile robot running at a maximum speed of 0.78 m/s demonstrate the power of the proposed algorithm},

  Abstract                 = {An inevitable collision state for a robotic system can be defined as a state for which, no matter what the future trajectory followed by the system is, a collision with an obstacle eventually occurs. An inevitable collision state takes into account the dynamics of both the system and the obstacles, fixed or moving. The main contribution of this paper is to lay down and explore this novel concept (and the companion concept of inevitable collision obstacle). Formal definitions of the inevitable collision states and obstacles are given. Properties fundamental for their characterisation are established. This concept is very general and can be useful both for navigation and motion planning purposes (for its own safety, a robotic system should never find itself in an inevitable collision state). To illustrate the interest of this concept, it is applied to a problem of safe motion planning for a robotic system subject to sensing constraints in a partially known environment (ie that may contain unexpected obstacles). In safe motion planning, the issue is to compute motions for which it is guaranteed that, no matter what happens at execution time, the robotic system never finds itself in a situation where there is no way for it to avoid collision with an unexpected obstacle},

All signals from sensors are processed by Arduino Uno microcontroller board and output from the Arduino Uno microcontroller board is implemented to control Quadcopter propellers. The GUI is designed using Visual Basic 2008 Express as interfacing communication between the Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) controller and the Quadcopter system. The experiment shows that the Quadcopter system can hover while maintain it balancing and the stability is guaranteed. Moreover, the developed system is able to cope with load disturbance up to 250 g during the hover position. Maximum operated time of Quadcopter is six minutes using 2200 mAh Lipo battery and operate time can be increased by using largest battery capacity},

As opposed to systems that override operator control as a last resort in order to avoid collisions (such as those found in modern automobiles), our approach is designed such that the operator can rely on the automatic collision avoidance, enabling intuitive and safe operator control of vehicles that may otherwise be difficult to control. Our approach continually extrapolates the future flight path of the vehicle given the current operator control input. If an imminent collision is predicted our algorithm will override the operator’s control input with the nearest control input that will actually let the vehicle avoid collisions with obstacles. This ensures safe flight while simultaneously maintaining the intent of the human operator as closely as possible. We successfully implemented our approach on a physical quadrotor system in a laboratory environment. In all experiments the human operator failed to crash the vehicle into floors, walls, ceilings, or obstacles, even when deliberately attempting to do so.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a unique real-time obstacle avoidance approach for manipulators and mobile robots based on the artificial potential field concept. Collision avoidance, tradi tionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, al lowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. This method has been extended to moving obstacles by using a time-varying artificial patential field. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm mechanisms and have used a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator con trol problem as direct control of manipulator motion in oper ational space—the space in which the task is originally described—rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kine matic transformation. Outside the obstacles' regions of influ ence, we caused the end effector to move in a straight line with an upper speed limit. The artificial potential field ap proach has been extended to collision avoidance for all ma nipulator links. In addition, a joint space artificial potential field is used to satisfy the manipulator internal joint con straints. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed by using visual sensing},

  Abstract                 = {Este documento mostra a modelagem matemática de um quadrimotor, onde foram feitas as seguintes considerações do sistema: é analisando como um corpo sólido o qual gira em 3D, o sistema foi modelado mediante a segunda lei de Newton e as equações de Euler- Lagrange, obtendo assim o sistema em função da geometria do quadrimotor e os ângulos de Euler nos eixos correspondentes. O método de controle é feito por planejamento de trajetórias e controle estocástico, com objetivo de controlar a não linearidade do sistema, fazendo assim que o sistema seja comportado de forma desejada em malha aberta. O desenvolvimento do projeto é baseado na construção e na simulação de trajetória desenhadas em MATLAB e SIMULINK, tendo condições iniciais definidas, com objetivo de obter os dados das simulações para a realização dos testes no quadrimotor. Como equipamento de trabalho foi disponibilizado um quadrimotor (Parrot Ar Drone), o qual tem desenvolvido um programa na plataforma de Java para sua comunicação.
A parte final do trabalho é fundamentada na análise estocástica do sistema em relação aos parâmetros do controle PID e PD, o qual permitiu a identificação do controlador que for projetado para a realização dos testes. Finalmente com o controlador projetado foram realizadas as provas e posteriormente foram processados e analisados os dados obtidos experimentalmente, para ser comparados com os dados teóricos enviados ao quadrimotor, com a finalidade de analisar o comportamento do controlador projetado no sistema real.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the modeling of a four rotor vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned air vehicle known as the quad rotor aircraft. The paper presents a new model design method for the flight control of an autonomous quad rotor. The paper describes the controller architecture for the quad rotor as well. The dynamic model of the quad-rotor, which is an under actuated aircraft with fixed four pitch angle rotors was described. The Modeling of a quad rotor vehicle is not an easy task because of its complex structure. The aim is to develop a model of the vehicle as realistic as possible. The model is used to design a stable and accurate controller. This paper explains the developments of a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control method to obtain stability in flying the Quad-rotor flying object. The model has four input forces which are basically the thrust provided by each propeller connected to each rotor with fixed angle. Forward (backward) motion is maintained by increasing (decreasing) speed of front (rear) rotor speed while decreasing (increasing) rear (front) rotor speed simultaneously which means changing the pitch angle. Left and right motion is accomplished by changing roll angle by the same way. The front and rear motors rotate counter-clockwise while other motors rotate clockwise so that the yaw command is derived by increasing (decreasing) counter-clockwise motors speed while decreasing (increasing) clockwise motor speeds},

The KF is designed aiming at estimating the states of the vehicle, fusing inertial and visual data. The nonlinear controller is designed with basis on a dynamic model of the AR.Drone, with the closed-loop stability proven using the theory of Lyapunov.

  Abstract                 = {To travel within the real world safely, an autonomous mobile robot has to perform obstacle avoidance. One of the most popular approaches to solve local obstacle avoidance is Dynamic Window approach. This approach is to search optimal control command of the robot in velocity space directly. The command which maximizes objective function is then selected as output command. In the original Dynamic Window approach, in order to avoid obstacles, it concerns only obstacles on robot’s trajectory. Therefore, the robot might crash with some obstacles which are near the trajectory but not on the trajectory. Therefore, in this work, we propose field Dynamic Window approach (F-DWA) which objective function is modified to consider the obstacles near the trajectory as well. This can be done by the use of histogram grid representation of obstacles to estimate the crashing probability of the trajectory. The objective function of Dynamic Window approach also depends on the crashing probability as well as other traditional factors. To test the robustness of proposed algorithm, experiment in real world is conducted. The result is the robot can travel safer when it concerns near-trajectory obstacles},

We pursue a systems solution for the hardware and software to enable autonomous flight with a small rotorcraft in complex indoor and outdoor environments using only onboard vision and inertial sensors. As rotorcrafts frequently operate in hover or near- hover conditions, we propose a vision-based state estimation ap- proach that does not drift when the vehicle remains stationary. The vision-based estimation approach combines the advantages of monocular vision (range, faster processing) with that of stereo vision (availability of scale and depth information), while overcoming several disadvantages of both. Specifically, our system relies on fisheye camera images at 25Hz and imagery from a second camera at a much lower frequency for metric scale initialization and failure recovery. This estimate is fused with IMU information to yield state estimates at 100 Hz for feedback control. We show indoor experimental results with performance benchmarking and illustrate the autonomous operation of the system in challenging indoor and outdoor environments},

  Abstract                 = {During the last years, there is an increasing demand for cheap and easy to operate platforms for surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. Therefore, the development of micro aerial vehicles is receiving an increasing attention. However, VTOL-MAVs often show an inherent instability that makes at least an automatic stabilization necessary, because otherwise the operator would not be able to keep these vehicles airborne. This requires the availability of navigation information, especially the vehicle's attitude has to be known.

This paper addresses the development of an integrated navigation system based on MEMS inertial sensors and GPS for a VTOL-MAV. Special attention is paid to the handling of GPS outages. While usually periods without GPS aiding can be bridged using the unaided strapdown solution, the poor quality of the MEMS inertial sensors prohibits this approach here. Therefore, during GPS outages the accelerometer data is interpreted as approximate measurements of the local gravity vector. Additionally, the usage of a magnetometer providing measurements of the Earth's magnetic field is motivated and discussed. Finally, flight test results illustrate the performance of the resulting system, proving that the achieved attitude accuracy is sufficient for the automatic control of the MAV. This holds in situations with permanent GPS loss and dynamic maneuvering, too.},
