  Abstract                 = {The major goal of this research was the development and implementation of an active control system to avoid collisions during the flight for a mini-quadrotor helicopter. However, the design aspects must be seriously studied in order to overcome hardware limitations and achieve control simplification. The controllers of an UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) robot deal with highly unstable dynamics and strong axes coupling. Furthermore, any additional onboard sensor increases the robot total weight and therefore decreases its operating time. It is necessary to find a balance between onboard electronics and robot operating time. This paper focuses not only on the development and implementation of a collision avoidance controller for a mini-VTOL robot using onboard ultrasound (US) sensors for detecting obstacles and for controlling its altitude, but also on the mathematical model that was essential for the controller developing phases as well. In order to facilitate the controller implementation, we developed a simulation tool in MatLab/Simulink using an accurate dynamic model of OS4 (our mini-VTOL robot). This tool allowed us to simulate and improve the OS4 controllers in different modeled environments and test different approaches. After that, the controllers were embedded in the real robot and the results were encouraging. At present time, this is an ongoing research being carried out with a new mini-VTOL flying robot configuration: a coaxial mini-helicopter},

  Abstract                 = {The major goal of this research was the development and implementation of a control system able to avoid collisions during the flight for a mini-quadrotor helicopter, based only on its embedded sensors without changing the environment. However, it is important to highlight that the design aspects must be seriously considered in order to overcome hardware limitations and achieve control simplification. The controllers of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) robot deal with highly unstable dynamics and strong axes coupling. Furthermore, any additional embedded sensor increases the robot total weight and therefore, decreases its operating time. The best balance between embedded electronics and robot operating time is desired. This paper focuses not only on the development and implementation of a collision avoidance controller for a mini-robotic helicopter using only its embedded sensors, but also on the mathematical model that was essential for the controller developing phases. Based on this model we carried out the development of a simulation tool based on MatLab/Simulink that was fundamental for setting the controllers' parameters. This tool allowed us to simulate and improve the OS4 controllers in different modeled environments and test different approaches. After that, the controllers were embedded in the real robot and the results proved to be very robust and feasible. In addition to this, the controller has the advantage of being compatible with future path planners that we are developing.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple direct method able to generate time- optimal trajectories for a micro quadrotor helicopter is presented. It is based on modeling the quadrotor trajectory as a composition of a parametric function P(λ) defining the quadrotor path, and a monotonically increasing function λ(t), specifying the motion on this path. The optimal evolutions of P(λ) andλ(t), which are approximated using B-spline functions, are found using a nonlinear optimization technique. The proposed method accounts for the most important constraints inherent to the system behavior, such as underactuation, obstacles avoidance and limits on actuator torques and speeds.},

No entanto, como a maior parte das abordagens propostas são adequadas para operação outdoor, apenas algumas técnicas foram projetadas para ambientes indoors, onde dispositivos não podem contar com o Sistema de Posicionamento Global (GPS) e, portanto, necessitam usar seus sensores exteroceptivos para navegação. Neste artigo, apresentamos um sistema de navegação genérico que permite a um sistema quadrotor de pequeno porte operar de forma autônoma em ambientes indoors. Para atingir este objetivo, que sistematicamente consiste na extensão e adaptação de técnicas aplicadas com sucesso em robôs terrestres, nós descrevemos todos os algoritmos e apresentamos um amplo conjunto de experiências, que ilustram a possibilidade de navegação autônoma de um quadrotor de forma confiável em ambientes indoors},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present an approach that aids the human operator of unmanned aerial vehicles by automatically performing collision avoidance with obstacles in the environ- ment so that the operator can focus on the global direction of motion of the vehicle. As opposed to systems that override operator control as a last resort in order to avoid collisions (such as those found in modern automobiles), our approach is designed such that the operator can rely on the automatic collision avoidance, enabling intuitive and safe operator control of vehicles that may otherwise be difficult to control. Our approach continually extrapolates the future flight path of the vehicle given the current operator control input. If an imminent collision is predicted our algorithm will override the operator’s control input with the nearest control input that will actually let the vehicle avoid collisions with obstacles. This ensures safe flight while simultaneously maintaining the intent of the human operator as closely as possible. We successfully implemented our approach on a physical quadrotor system in a laboratory environment. In all experiments the human operator failed to crash the vehicle into floors, walls, ceilings, or obstacles, even when deliberately attempting to do so.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the modeling of a four rotor vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned air vehicle known as the quad rotor aircraft. The paper presents a new model design method for the flight control of an autonomous quad rotor. The paper describes the controller architecture for the quad rotor as well. The dynamic model of the quad-rotor, which is an under actuated aircraft with fixed four pitch angle rotors was described. The Modeling of a quad rotor vehicle is not an easy task because of its complex structure. The aim is to develop a model of the vehicle as realistic as possible. The model is used to design a stable and accurate controller. This paper explains the developments of a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control method to obtain stability in flying the Quad-rotor flying object. The model has four input forces which are basically the thrust provided by each propeller connected to each rotor with fixed angle. Forward (backward) motion is maintained by increasing (decreasing) speed of front (rear) rotor speed while decreasing (increasing) rear (front) rotor speed simultaneously which means changing the pitch angle. Left and right motion is accomplished by changing roll angle by the same way. The front and rear motors rotate counter-clockwise while other motors rotate clockwise so that the yaw command is derived by increasing (decreasing) counter-clockwise motors speed while decreasing (increasing) clockwise motor speeds},
